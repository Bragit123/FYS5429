# FYS5429

Repository for the project-oriented course FYS5429 â€“ Advanced machine learning and data analysis for the physical sciences.
In this course we want to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch. Everything related to this project is in the *Project* folder, while the *Play_Area* folder has only been used to test out functionality or play around with things in a "safe" environment apart from the project code.

To reproduce results from the report run `python mnist.py`, by default it is set to reproduce the averagepool plot. If you run from MacOS you may want to consider running the code with the caffeinate command: `caffeinate -i python mnist.py`, as it takes quite some time.
