# Project

In this folder we keep everything related to the CNN-from-scratch project. In the *Code* folder you can find the code for our CNN network, as well as code for building and training this network, and producing accuracy plots. The plots generated from running our code can be found in the *Figures* folder. The file *FYS5429 Project.pdf* is the complete report from the project.
